# Ae1 Database project

## Introduction 
This is a project I had to work on during my university. The main purpose of this project was the create a database logging programs which logs data using a web application. For the project, we had to choose our one project theme however the project theme must solve a problem and be very realistic. 
 
 My project was based on my local family business. Our family has a local store in a very old village which doesn't even have street lights. As a result in an area like this everyone knows everyone therefore sometimes customers may owe there local stores such as ours however our business normally writes down name and amount due on a little piece of paper which most of the time gets lost or messy. 


 After seeing this situation again and again I decided to make this into a CRUD app which will allow the user to add details related to the transaction and update them. 

## System overview

Below you can see the screen shots of my web application. The web application mostly contains forms and shows the data. the titles are :

- ID: This is for the dataset and it is how it is identified. 
- Name: This is where the person behind the till would enter the customer's name who wishes to pay later.
- Date: The date would also be entered this is because it can be easy to trace CCTV footage if necessary.
- Price: The price of the totals.
- Method of payment: This is how the customers would like to pay when they return.
- Reason for the IOU: The reason why they didn't pay.
